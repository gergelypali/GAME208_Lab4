GAME 208 LAB4 / UI elements
I used the LAB2 project as the starting point. Tasks were to add a Spawn Menu to the game so the player can change various parameters around the spawning.
These parameters are:
max number of a given enemy in the spawn queue, this is an input field for each enemy
choose which enemy the player want to spawn with buttons
I added a visual representation of the enemy prefabs, spinning prefabs on the menu
player can see the current enemy count in the spawn queue
player can see the timer how long the next enemy spawns
